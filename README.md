# What is it?
[JellyfinSkipButtons](https://github.com/Jaakurin/JellyfinSkipButtons) is a simple JavaScript function written for [JS Injector](https://github.com/n00bcodr/Jellyfin-JavaScript-Injector) that replaces the existing Fast-Forward and Rewind buttons in the Jellyfin Web playback interface with Skip Forward and Skip Back functionality. 

This is accomplished by a simple remapping of the existing buttons to behave like the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard.

# How do I use it?

You will first need to install and configure the [JS Injector](https://github.com/n00bcodr/Jellyfin-JavaScript-Injector) plugin. Once that is done, do this:
- Open the JS Injector settings in your Jellyfin admin dashbaord.
- Click Add Script.
- Name it whatever makes sense to you.
- Click on this link and paste the code into the JavaScript field: [JellyfinSkipButtons.js](https://github.com/Jaakurin/JellyfinSkipButtons/blob/main/JellyfinSkipButtons.js)
- Click save, clear your browser cache, and you're done!
